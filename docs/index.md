# Preamble

Greetings. You may know me as `11yu` from various botmaking / imagegen discords.

This guide is **mostly made with local generation in mind**, and is **not a good introduction to imagegen in general.** You can check out some [#other guides](./Appendix/other_guides.md) for that. Instead, I'll be focusing more on:

- 1-2 steps further into the technical aspects of what a usual imagegen guide may provide.
	- This hopefully means somewhere between guides that say "Use X (if Y)" with little to no explanation, and those that dive head first into the meat and potatoes with heavy math equations and terminology hell.
	- You might find these more gory details in sections marked `[DD]`, or a separate `Deep Dive` section at the end of a page, if it exists.
- lesser-known tips, tricks, and technologies that *may* improve your imagegen process.

**Everything here should be taken with a mountain of salt,** as in practice, many other variables could influence your results greatly. Also, this article is mostly written by a dumb person (me). You will likely come out of a section thinking: "Interesting. This doesn't help me at all."

With that in mind, let's dive in.
